# Introduction to Data Structures

Sets are a fundamental concept to both mathematics and computer science. 
However, mathematical sets are typically unchanging, whereas sets manipulated by algorithms can grow, shrink, and change over time.

In other words, the sets we are typically concerned with in CS are *dynamic*.
Algorithms requre several different types of operations to be performed on sets. For example, many algorithms need only the ability to insert elements into, delete elements from, and test membership in a set.
We call a dynamic set that supports these operations a **dictionary**.

## Operations on dynamic sets

Operations can be grouped into two main categories:

(1) queries (ex. SEARCH, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, SUCCESSOR, PREDECESSOR)

(2) modifying operations (ex. INSERT, DELETE)
